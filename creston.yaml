location_descrip: The Town of Creston is nestled between the Purcell and Selkirk Mountains. A block from downtown Creston, two huge grain elevators stand overlooking the wide Creston Flats. The elevators are idle, but agriculture continues to play an essential role in the town today. This is evident in Crestonâ€™s many farms and orchards, and their involvement in the slow food movement. Creston and the nearby East Shore of Kootenay Lake communities also boast a number of flourishing artist studios and galleries. See www.creston.ca for more information.

# Migration

This indicator measures the movement of people into and out of the community with respect to where they lived five years prior.[^1] Non-movers are those who have not moved. Non-migrants are people who have moved within the same region. Migrants include those who moved within the province (intra-provincial), those who moved to or from another province (inter-provincial), and those who moved to Canada from another country (external migrants).
